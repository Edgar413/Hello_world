# Hello_world
Just another repository

Hi,everybody! Nice to meet you on GitHub.
I`m a student to study ocean acoustics in Beijing.


# the Note of 《GitHub Guide》
1. By default your repository has one branch named master which is considered to be the definitive branch. We use branches to experiment and make edits before committing them to master. master为初始默认分支，也被视为主分支。在分支上做测试修改，完成后再交付给主分支。

2. When you create a branch off the master branch, you’re making a copy, or snapshot, of master as it was at that point in time. If someone else made changes to the master branch while you were working on your branch, you could pull in those updates. 其他分支建立时都相当于彼时主分支的拷贝或者快照。如果主分支发生变化，非主分支均可下拉获取更新。

3. A new branch called feature (because we’re doing ‘feature work’ on this branch). The journey that feature takes before it’s merged into master.
